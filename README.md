# hello-world
Test repository

I am an IT professional with a degree in aeronautical engineering,
Graduate Diploma in Computing and extensive experience working
within the Oracle Support organisation. I joined Oracle Support as a
front-line technical support analyst and gained extensive customer
service and support experience, often working on multiple customer
issues concurrently. This required exceptional customer management,
prioritisation and communication skills.
Most recently I worked in the Customer Environment Labs (CEL)
global team which provided and maintained environments for Oracle
Support. As well as manually provisioning environments on both Unix
and Windows servers for Oracle RAC (Real Application Clusters) and
Database support analysts, I also successfully designed, coded and
implemented two major applications which automated this provisioning
on Unix platforms. These two projects provided me the opportunity to
build on my existing knowledge of Oracle database architecture, Unix
shell scripting and HTML by teaching myself Perl, Javascript, jQuery
and AJAX as I was developing these full-stack automation
applications. The CEL team also maintained Oracle E-business suite
environments and used VMware to provide virtual machines. As part
of the team I often assisted with these functions.
Thus in my last role I wore many hats: developer, innovator,
troubleshooter, problem solver, database administrator and systems
administrator. I am a detail-oriented, flexible self-starter with strong
written and verbal communication skills who thrives on new
challenges. I am equally passionate about developing versatile,
reusable and modular code as well as analysing, diagnosing and fixing
difficult issues to help customers optimise their software usage.
Working equally well independently and as a team player, I
thoroughly enjoy learning new technologies.
I am now seeking permanent or contract roles in development, support
or database administration.
